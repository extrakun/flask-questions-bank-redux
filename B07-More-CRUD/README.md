# Book CRUD
Create a new Flask app inside app.py

A book has the following fields:
```
{
    "isbn":"X123-456",
    "title":"The Lord of the Rings",
    "type":"non-fiction",
    "genre":"fantasy",
    "tags":["page-turner", "poetic", "doorstopper"],
    "author":"J.R.R Tolkien",
    "synospis":"A halfing must destroy stolen jewellery"
}
```
**Some Notes:**
* The ISBN of a book is always unique. 
* Type can be `non-fiction` or `fiction`
* Genre can be `fantasy`, `science-fic`, `romance` or `slice-of-life`
